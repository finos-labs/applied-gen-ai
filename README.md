# FINOS LLM Exploration

**Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Financial Services**

This repository is the home of the FINOS LLM Exploration initiative, a collaborative project focused on identifying and developing innovative use cases for LLMs in the financial services industry, while addressing the challenges of governance, security, and compliance.

The LLM-E Initiative is acting as a "proto-SIG" (Special Interest Group), with the goal of becoming an official FINOS SIG - we run our meetings as SIGs, and the goal is to foster the development of cross-industry collaborative code initiatives focused on non-competetive AI/LLM Use Caseswhich can be contributed as full FINOS Projects.

## Goals

* **Identify valuable LLM use cases:**  Explore how LLMs can be applied to various tasks in finance, such as risk management, customer service, compliance, and investment analysis.
* **Develop open-source tools and models:** Contribute to the development of open-source LLMs, tools, and frameworks that can be used by the financial services community.
* **Promote responsible AI:** Address ethical considerations, bias mitigation, and explainability in LLM development and deployment.
* **Foster collaboration:** Encourage collaboration between financial institutions, technology providers, and researchers to accelerate LLM adoption and innovation.

## Key Activities

* **Use Case Exploration:** Identify and prioritize promising use cases for LLMs in finance. This includes:
    * Financial document analysis and understanding
    * Regulatory compliance
    * Risk management
    * Customer service and engagement
* **Prototype Development:** Develop prototypes and proof-of-concepts to demonstrate the feasibility and value of LLM applications.
* **Open Source Contributions:** Contribute to existing open-source LLM projects or create new open-source tools and models.
* **Community Building:** Organize workshops, hackathons, and other events to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing.
* **Research and Development:** Conduct research on LLM capabilities, limitations, and best practices for deployment in finance.
